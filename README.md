# Bones-Battle
You can think of Bones Battle as a simplified version of the board game Risk. Our version has two to five players, distinguished by name and color. All but one of the players is played by the computer, with the human controlling the fifth (green) player. The game board is a connected arrangement of colored squares (territories), each labeled with an initial quantity of 6–sided dice. A turn consists of 0 or more attacks, each from a square with 2 or more dice to an adjacent (sharing a side) opponent’s square. If the roll of the attacker’s dice total more than the opponent’s total, the attacked square’s ownership transfers to the attacker and all but one of the attacking dice are moved to it. Otherwise, the attacking square loses all but one of its dice. These totals are briefly displayed on the attacking/defending squares. Totals in white mean that the attacker won, while magenta means the defender prevailed. When a turn is complete, the computer determines the quantity of squares in the largest connected cluster of squares owned by the player. A number of dice equal to this quantity is added randomly to the player’s squares, to a maximum of eight per square.
